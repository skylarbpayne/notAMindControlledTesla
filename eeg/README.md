## Setup
This assumes that python 3.5+ and virtualenv are installed.
Execute `source init_env.sh`. This will create and start a python virtualenv
and install all necessary packages. This assumes that a linux based system is
being used -- if not, you're on your own.

When you're finished, you can exit the virtualenv by executing `deactivate`.
